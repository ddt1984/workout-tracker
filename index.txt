   - Free hosting with Pages

3. Tap-First Interface
   - +/- buttons instead of text input
   - Large 44x44px touch targets
   - Pre-filled values from history
   - Copy workflow optimized

4. Korean Date Format
   - Native "M월 D일" format preserved
   - Backward compatible with existing files
   - No manual text editing needed

5. Mobile-First CSS
   - Dark mode default (gym lighting)
   - Portrait orientation optimized
   - Thumb-friendly button placement
   - Minimal scrolling needed

📱 USAGE WORKFLOW
=================

Typical Gym Session (5-10 seconds):
1. Open app (from home screen)
2. Tap "📋 최근 복사" (Copy Latest)
3. Adjust 2-3 weights with +/- buttons
4. Tap "저장 ✓" (Save)
5. Done! Automatically commits to GitHub

vs. Current Manual Method (~30-60 seconds):
1. Open Google Drive
2. Find workout folder
3. Open text file
4. Scroll to top
5. Copy previous workout
6. Paste and edit date
7. Edit weights/reps
8. Save
9. Wait for sync

Result: 5x faster! 🚀
